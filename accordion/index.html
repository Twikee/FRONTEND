      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting 
      industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text 
      ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a 
      galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

      Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
      It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
       making it over 2000 years old.

      There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,
       but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected
        humour, or randomised words which don't 
        look even slightly believable.
